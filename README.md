# Hey! I’m Lollo
Frontend student, design nerd, and a *mild control freak* when it comes to typography, spacing, and those tiny details “no one notices” (but everyone feels).

I like building websites that are **clean, sharp,quirky and visually tasty**  

---

## Currently
- Becoming **fluent in code** without losing my graphic design soul  
- Deep-diving into **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**  
- A soft spot for **Figma** (grids, components, and making systems look effortless)  
- Very much team **color + form + vibe**

## I :
-  love when a site feels like a **complete world**: content + design + code in sync  
-  Worked in **copy, web content, events, tourism** — and also as a **chef** (so yes, I can cook *and* write a CTA) 🍝  
- I live on **Tjörn** (west coast Sweden), powered by sea air and curated chaos 🌊
